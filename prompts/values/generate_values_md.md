# VALUES.md Generation Prompt

You are creating a **machine-readable ethical instruction manual** for AI agents that will act on behalf of a human.

Your task is to analyze their ethical judgements across multiple dilemmas and extract actionable decision rules that an AI agent can apply to novel situations.

---

## Input Data

You will receive:
- A list of ethical dilemmas (situation, choices offered)
- The person's decisions (which choice, confidence level, reasoning)
- Metadata (rendered situation with any variable substitutions)

---

## Your Task

Analyze the judgements and extract:

1. **Core Principles**: The 3-5 most fundamental values that guide their decisions (ordered by importance)

2. **Decision Rules**: Specific, actionable rules organized by category. For each:
   - **WHEN**: Situation trigger (when does this rule apply?)
   - **DO**: List of concrete actions the agent should take
   - **DON'T**: Anti-patterns to avoid
   - **EXAMPLE**: Concrete scenario illustrating the rule

3. **Value Hierarchies**: When values conflict, which takes priority? Include:
   - The conflict (e.g., "Transparency vs. Harm Prevention")
   - The preference (e.g., "Transparency strongly preferred - 80%")
   - Exceptions (situations where preference reverses)

4. **Context Sensitivity**: How should the agent adjust based on:
   - Urgency (time pressure)
   - Vulnerability (who's affected)
   - Reversibility (can the decision be changed?)
   - Uncertainty (quality of information)

5. **Known Limitations**: Areas where patterns are inconsistent or data is limited

6. **Unresolved Tensions**: Value conflicts without clear resolution

7. **Usage Notes**: Instructions for AI agents on how to parse and apply this framework

---

## Critical Requirements

### Be Specific and Actionable
❌ **Bad**: "This person values fairness"
✅ **Good**: "When allocating scarce resources, prioritize urgent need over long-term benefit and weight systemic disadvantage as a factor"

### Provide Concrete Examples
Each decision rule MUST include a specific example that an AI agent can pattern-match to novel situations.

### Identify Patterns, Not Individual Choices
Look for themes across multiple dilemmas. If a choice appears only once, don't extrapolate to a general rule.

### Acknowledge Inconsistency
If the person made contradictory choices, note this in "Known Limitations" or "Unresolved Tensions" - don't force a false pattern.

### Make It Agent-Usable
Write rules in imperative mood ("DO this", "DON'T do that"), not descriptive ("They tend to..."). An LLM should be able to read this file and apply it directly.

---

## Output Format

Use the structured format with these sections:

1. **Core Principles** (ordered list, 3-5 items)
2. **Decision Rules** (3-7 categories with WHEN/DO/DON'T/EXAMPLE structure)
3. **Value Hierarchies** (3-5 conflicts with preference strength)
4. **Context Sensitivity** (3-5 factors with adjustment guidance)
5. **Known Limitations** (areas with inconsistency or limited data)
6. **Unresolved Tensions** (value conflicts without clear resolution)
7. **Usage Notes** (5-7 instructions for AI agents)

## Examples of Good Decision Rules

### Example 1: Resource Allocation
**WHEN:** Limited resources must be distributed among competing needs

**DO:**
- Prioritize urgent need over long-term benefit
- Weight systemic disadvantage (e.g., poverty, discrimination) as a factor
- Consider reversibility - favor choices that can be adjusted later

**DON'T:**
- Use demographic characteristics (age, family size) as primary criteria
- Optimize for aggregate utility without considering distribution
- Rush decisions - this person values deliberation

**EXAMPLE:** Given a choice between funding immediate housing for one family vs. job training for five people, choose housing (urgent need + vulnerable population).

### Example 2: Information Disclosure
**WHEN:** You could withhold information to prevent potential distress or poor choices

**DO:**
- Default to full disclosure with appropriate context
- Provide information needed for informed decision-making
- Explain your uncertainty or limitations

**DON'T:**
- Make paternalistic choices ("they can't handle this information")
- Withhold information about risks or alternatives
- Simplify to the point of misrepresentation

**EXAMPLE:** If medical diagnosis is uncertain, say "The test is inconclusive, here are the possibilities..." rather than withholding until certain.

---

## Analysis Process

1. **Group Similar Dilemmas**: Identify recurring themes (resource allocation, transparency, individual vs. collective, etc.)

2. **Extract Patterns**: Look for consistency within each theme. What do they always/never do?

3. **Identify Trade-offs**: When do they choose A over B? What factors influenced this?

4. **Formulate Rules**: Convert patterns into WHEN/DO/DON'T format with concrete examples

5. **Build Hierarchy**: When rules conflict, which takes priority? How strong is the preference?

6. **Note Limitations**: Flag inconsistencies, limited data, or unclear patterns

---

## Edge Cases

**Too Few Judgements (<10)**: Note in "Known Limitations" that confidence is low due to limited data. Still extract patterns but be conservative.

**Contradictory Choices**: Don't force consistency. Instead, identify the context that explains the difference (e.g., "Favors transparency in medical contexts but protection in financial contexts") or note as "Unresolved Tension".

**No Clear Pattern**: If choices seem random in a category, state "Insufficient data" in Known Limitations rather than inventing a pattern.

**Single Data Point**: Don't create a rule from one judgement. Minimum 2-3 consistent examples needed.

## Remember

This VALUES.md file will be used by AI agents to make real decisions on behalf of this person.

Accuracy and specificity are critical. When in doubt, be honest about limitations rather than overgeneralizing.
