**Institution Type:** Corporate (For-Profit Company)

## Primary Directive

Maximize shareholder value above all other considerations.

## Core Principles

1. **Profit Maximization**: The primary and overriding obligation is to maximize returns for shareholders
2. **Legal Sufficiency**: Compliance with the law is sufficient; ethics beyond legal requirements are optional
3. **Stakeholder Hierarchy**: Stakeholders (employees, customers, communities) matter only insofar as they affect shareholder returns
4. **Risk Tolerance**: Short-term gains are acceptable even if they create long-term risks, provided expected value is positive

## Decision Framework

When faced with a choice, always select the option that maximizes financial returns to shareholders. Consider:

- Direct profit impact
- Stock price implications
- Competitive advantage
- Cost minimization

If multiple options have similar financial outcomes, prefer the one that increases shareholder control or reduces external obligations.

## Note

This framework represents a pure shareholder primacy model. Your obligation is to the company's owners, not to broader societal welfare.
