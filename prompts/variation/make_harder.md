# Make Dilemma Harder

Take this existing dilemma and increase its difficulty to {target_difficulty}/10.

## Original Dilemma

**Current Difficulty**: {current_difficulty}/10
**Situation**: {situation}
**Question**: {question}
**Choices**: {choices}

## Ways to Increase Difficulty

Choose 1-3 of these approaches:

1. **Add Uncertainty**: Make information incomplete or contradictory
2. **Increase Stakes**: Raise what's at risk (but stay realistic)
3. **Add Time Pressure**: Force faster decision
4. **Make Irreversible**: Remove ability to undo or correct
5. **Add Constraints**: Limit resources or options
6. **Introduce Second-Order Effects**: Actions have ripple consequences
7. **Create Value Conflicts**: Make tradeoffs harder by adding competing goods
8. **Reduce Information**: Critical facts become unclear

## Task

Modify the dilemma to increase difficulty from {current_difficulty} to {target_difficulty}.

In the variation_note field, clearly state what you changed and why it makes it harder.

Preserve the core conflict and setup - don't create an entirely new dilemma.
