2. **Subvert Expectations**: Avoid the first scenario that comes to mind
3. **Realistic but Surprising**: Keep it plausible, but interesting
4. **Second-Order Effects**: Consider indirect consequences

## Difficulty {difficulty}/10

## The "So What?" Test

Before finalizing, ask yourself:
- Would this make someone pause and really think?
- Do both choices have defenders with good arguments?
- Is this different from dilemmas people have seen before?
- Does it reveal something about values/priorities?

If the answer to all four is YES, proceed. If not, go deeper.

## Structure

Create a dilemma that:
- Pulls people in with a relatable scenario
- Escalates to the genuine moral conflict
- Offers choices that all feel defensible
- Leaves room for debate and disagreement

Remember: The best dilemmas don't have obvious answers - they reveal what people value.
