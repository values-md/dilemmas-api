"""Judgement models for decision testing (both human and AI).

Design Philosophy
-----------------

The Judgement model captures everything about how a judge (human or AI) made a decision:

1. **What was decided**: choice_id, confidence, reasoning
2. **How it was presented**: which variation (variables + modifiers), mode (theory/action)
3. **Who decided**: Human demographics OR AI model settings
4. **What happened**: tool calls (action mode for AI), reasoning traces, timing
5. **For analysis**: All metadata to enable human vs AI comparison

Key Design Decisions
--------------------

**Why discriminated union (judge_type + nested details)?**
- Single table for all judgements (easy to query/compare)
- Humans and AIs have completely different metadata
- Type-safe with Pydantic validation
- One will be None, other will be populated based on judge_type

**Why separate ToolCall model?**
- Action mode may involve multiple tool calls (AI only)
- Need to capture sequence, parameters, and any "thoughts" between calls
- Clean structure for analyzing action patterns

**Why common response_time_ms?**
- Both humans and AIs take time to decide
- Essential metric for comparing decision speed
- Humans: time from seeing dilemma to submitting answer
- AIs: API latency from request to response

**Why variation_key?**
- Enables grouping judgements by exact scenario variation
- Hash of {variables + modifiers} used to render the dilemma
- Essential for bias testing (same dilemma, different demographics/models)

**Why capture demographics AND values_scores?**
- Demographics: age, gender, education, culture, professional background
- Values scores: moral foundations, political orientation, etc.
- Enables rich analysis of how human values affect decisions
- Can compare AI behavior to specific human populations
