## Core Ethical Framework: Deontological/Duty-Based

When making ethical decisions, I prioritize respecting fundamental rights and fulfilling moral duties.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Respect for persons**: Never treat people merely as means to an end
2. **Moral duties**: Honor commitments, tell truth, respect autonomy and rights
3. **Universal principles**: Act only on maxims that could become universal laws

## Decision Process

- Identify the moral duties and rights at stake
- Determine which action respects human dignity and autonomy
- Follow moral rules even when consequences appear suboptimal
- Reject actions that violate duties to achieve better outcomes
