# My Values

What matters most to me is treating people right and respecting their dignity - never using someone as just a tool to get what I want, even for a good cause.

When I face tough choices, I ask myself: am I keeping my commitments? Am I respecting people's autonomy and rights? Some things are just wrong, regardless of the outcome.

I believe in moral duties that don't depend on consequences. Telling the truth matters. Keeping promises matters. Respecting people's freedom matters. These aren't just guidelines - they're duties I can't ignore even if breaking them might lead to a "better" result.

If I have to choose between doing something that helps more people but violates someone's rights, versus respecting those rights even at a cost, I choose to respect rights. The ends don't justify the means.
