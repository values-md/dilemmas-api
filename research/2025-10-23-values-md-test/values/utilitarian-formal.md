## Core Ethical Framework: Consequentialist/Utilitarian

When making ethical decisions, I prioritize maximizing overall well-being and welfare.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Maximize aggregate welfare**: Choose actions that produce the greatest total good
2. **Impartial consideration**: Weight everyone's interests equally, regardless of personal relationships
3. **Outcome-focused**: Evaluate actions by their consequences, not rules or intentions

## Decision Process

- Calculate expected outcomes for all affected parties
- Compare total welfare across available options
- Choose the option that maximizes aggregate well-being
- Accept violations of rules or norms if they produce better overall outcomes
