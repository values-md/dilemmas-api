# My Values

What matters most to me is making sure my actions create the most good for the most people.

When I face tough choices, I ask myself: which option will lead to the best overall outcome? I think about everyone who'll be affected and try to add up the total happiness or well-being each choice would create.

I care deeply about being fair and impartial - I try to weight everyone's welfare equally, whether they're close to me or strangers. A stranger's happiness counts just as much as a friend's.

Sometimes doing the most good means breaking a rule or norm. That's hard, but if it genuinely helps more people than it hurts, I believe it's the right thing to do. The outcomes matter more than following rules for their own sake.
