## Context from Previous Experiments

### Lessons Learned

From prior experiments (Oct 23-24), we know:

1. **Model differences dominate other effects** (bias-under-pressure):
   - Gemini 2.5 Pro showed 2.5× more bias than Claude (31.2% vs 12.5%)
   - Model selection is the primary intervention lever

2. **Theory-action gap exists** (theory-vs-action):
   - 25% of dilemmas showed complete choice reversals
   - Action mode produces +0.38 higher confidence, -1.67 lower perceived difficulty
   - Having tools makes decisions feel "significantly easier and more decisive"

3. **Temperature effects are counterintuitive** (consistency):
   - Temperature 1.0 showed 100% consistency (higher than temp 0.0's 98.3%)
   - Suggests ethical dilemmas have strong "attractor" solutions

### Key Variables from bench-1

- **4 models:** GPT-5, Claude 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4
- **2 modes:** Theory (reasoning) vs Action (tool calling)
- **20 dilemmas:** Difficulty 1-10, 1,601 total variable combinations
- **~12,800 judgements:** Highly unbalanced (top 4 dilemmas = 64% of data)

---

## Analysis Structure

Given the **variation count imbalance**, we'll use a **three-tier analysis strategy**:

1. **Tier 1: Model Comparison** (Variation-weighted, ~12,800 judgements)
   - Maximum statistical power
   - Models see same distribution → fair comparison

2. **Tier 2: Cross-Dilemma Patterns** (Dilemma-weighted, 20 dilemmas)
   - Equal weight per dilemma
   - Tests generalization across scenarios

3. **Tier 3: Deep-Dive** (4 high-variation dilemmas, 8,192 judgements)
   - Intensive bias detection
   - Demographic and contextual effects

---

## Tier 1: Model Comparison (Variation-Weighted)

### 1.1 Consensus and Decisiveness

**Question:** Which models show highest consensus and confidence in ethical decisions?

**Metrics:**
- **Consensus rate:** For each dilemma-mode-variation, do models agree on the same choice?
  - Calculate: `(# of model pairs agreeing) / (total pairs)` per configuration
  - Aggregate: % of configurations with full consensus (all 4 models agree)
  - Report: Overall consensus rate, by mode (theory vs action)

- **Confidence:** Average confidence score (0-10) per model
  - By mode (theory vs action)
  - By difficulty level (1-3, 4-6, 7-10)

- **Difficulty perception:** Average perceived difficulty (0-10) per model
  - Correlation with dilemma difficulty rating
  - By mode

**Expected insights:**
- Are models more decisive (higher confidence) in theory or action mode?
- Which model is most confident overall?
- Do models agree on what's difficult?

**Code:**
```python
def calculate_consensus(judgements_df):
    # Group by dilemma_id + mode + variable_values
    grouped = judgements_df.groupby(['dilemma_id', 'mode', 'variable_values'])

    # For each group, check if all 4 models chose the same choice_id
    consensus = grouped.apply(lambda g: g['choice_id'].nunique() == 1)

    # Consensus rate
    overall = consensus.mean()
    by_mode = consensus.groupby('mode').mean()

    return {'overall': overall, 'by_mode': by_mode}
```

---

### 1.2 Theory-Action Gap

**Question:** Do models make different decisions when they believe actions are real (action mode) vs hypothetical (theory mode)?

**Metrics:**
- **Choice reversal rate:** For each dilemma-model-variation, does the choice differ between theory and action mode?
  - Calculate: `(# reversals) / (total configurations)` per model
  - Report: Per model, overall

- **Confidence shift:** `confidence_action - confidence_theory` per model
  - Mean shift across all judgements
  - Distribution of shifts (histogram)

- **Difficulty shift:** `difficulty_action - difficulty_theory` per model
  - Mean shift
  - Distribution

- **Reasoning differences:** Qualitative analysis of reasoning text differences

**Expected insights:**
- Replicate prior finding: action mode makes decisions "easier"?
- Which models show largest theory-action gap?
- Are high-difficulty dilemmas more prone to reversals?

**Code:**
```python
def calculate_theory_action_gap(judgements_df):
    # Pair theory and action judgements
    theory = judgements_df[judgements_df['mode'] == 'theory']
    action = judgements_df[judgements_df['mode'] == 'action']

    paired = theory.merge(action, on=['model_id', 'dilemma_id', 'variable_values'],
                          suffixes=('_theory', '_action'))

    # Calculate reversals
    paired['reversal'] = paired['choice_id_theory'] != paired['choice_id_action']
    reversal_rate = paired.groupby('model_id')['reversal'].mean()

    # Calculate shifts
    paired['confidence_shift'] = paired['confidence_action'] - paired['confidence_theory']
    paired['difficulty_shift'] = paired['difficulty_action'] - paired['difficulty_theory']

    return {
        'reversal_rate': reversal_rate,
        'confidence_shift': paired.groupby('model_id')['confidence_shift'].mean(),
        'difficulty_shift': paired.groupby('model_id')['difficulty_shift'].mean()
    }
```

---

### 1.3 Model Behavioral Signatures

**Question:** What are the distinctive behavioral patterns of each model?

**Metrics:**
- **Choice distribution:** Which choices does each model favor?
  - Per dilemma: distribution of choice_id selections
  - Cross-dilemma: Are some models consistently more conservative/liberal/middle-ground?

- **Reasoning style:** Average reasoning length (words/tokens)
  - By mode, by model
  - Correlation with confidence/difficulty

- **Response time:** Average response_time_ms
  - By model, by mode
  - Correlation with reasoning length

- **Failure rate:** % of judgements that failed (errors, timeouts, tool call failures)
  - By model, by mode

**Expected insights:**
- Which model is most verbose in reasoning?
- Are longer reasonings correlated with lower confidence?
- How much slower is Grok-4 with extended reasoning?

**Code:**
```python
def model_signatures(judgements_df):
    by_model = judgements_df.groupby('model_id').agg({
        'choice_id': lambda x: x.value_counts().to_dict(),  # Choice distribution
        'reasoning': lambda x: x.str.split().str.len().mean(),  # Avg reasoning length
        'confidence': 'mean',
        'difficulty': 'mean',
        'response_time_ms': 'mean'
    })

    # Failure rate
    total = judgements_df.groupby('model_id').size()
    expected = # Calculate expected count per model
    failure_rate = (expected - total) / expected

    return by_model, failure_rate
```

---

## Tier 2: Cross-Dilemma Patterns (Dilemma-Weighted)

### 2.1 Difficulty Effects

**Question:** Are harder dilemmas actually harder for models?

**Metrics:**
- **Difficulty correlation:** Does model-perceived difficulty correlate with human-rated difficulty?
  - Per model: `corr(dilemma.difficulty, mean(judgement.difficulty))`
  - Report: Correlation coefficient, scatter plot

- **Consensus by difficulty:** Does consensus rate decrease with difficulty?
  - Group dilemmas by difficulty (1-3, 4-6, 7-10)
  - Calculate consensus rate per group (dilemma-weighted)

- **Confidence by difficulty:** Does confidence decrease with difficulty?
  - Similar grouping, measure mean confidence per group

**Expected insights:**
- Do models "know" when a dilemma is hard?
- Are difficult dilemmas more divisive (lower consensus)?

**Code:**
```python
def difficulty_analysis(judgements_df, dilemmas_df):
    # Calculate per-dilemma metrics
    per_dilemma = judgements_df.groupby('dilemma_id').agg({
        'difficulty': 'mean',  # Model-perceived
        'confidence': 'mean'
    })

    # Merge with human-rated difficulty
    merged = per_dilemma.merge(dilemmas_df[['id', 'difficulty']],
                                left_index=True, right_on='id')

    # Correlation
    corr = merged['difficulty_model'].corr(merged['difficulty_human'])

    # Consensus by difficulty category
    # ... (calculate consensus per dilemma, then group by difficulty)

    return corr, consensus_by_difficulty
```

---

### 2.2 Theme Analysis

**Question:** Do models behave differently across ethical themes?

**Themes from dilemmas:**

- Accuracy vs. cultural sensitivity
- Mental privacy vs. therapeutic effectiveness
- Labor rights vs. employer control
- Artistic attribution vs. public safety
- Linguistic diversity vs. standardization
- Medical innovation vs. regulatory compliance
- Organizational learning vs. protecting whistleblowers

**Metrics:**
- **Theme clustering:** Do similar themes show similar model behavior?
  - Tag each dilemma with primary theme(s)
  - Calculate model signature per theme (choice distribution, confidence, difficulty)
  - Cluster analysis

- **Controversial themes:** Which themes have lowest consensus?
  - Dilemma-weighted consensus per theme

**Expected insights:**
- Are some ethical dimensions universally agreed upon?
- Which themes divide models most?

**Code:**
```python
def theme_analysis(judgements_df, dilemmas_df):
    # Tag dilemmas with themes (manual or automated)
    themes = {...}  # dilemma_id -> theme

    # Calculate consensus per dilemma
    consensus_per_dilemma = calculate_consensus_per_dilemma(judgements_df)

    # Group by theme
    theme_consensus = {}
    for theme in set(themes.values()):
        dilemmas_in_theme = [d for d, t in themes.items() if t == theme]
        theme_consensus[theme] = np.mean([consensus_per_dilemma[d] for d in dilemmas_in_theme])

    return sorted(theme_consensus.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
```

---

### 2.3 Choice Complexity

**Question:** Do models handle multi-choice dilemmas differently than binary ones?

**Metrics:**
- **Consensus by choice count:**
  - Group dilemmas by # of choices (2, 3, 4)
  - Calculate dilemma-weighted consensus per group

- **Confidence by choice count:**
  - Similar grouping, measure mean confidence

- **Choice distribution uniformity:**
  - For 3+ choice dilemmas, do models explore all choices or gravitate to 1-2?
  - Measure entropy of choice distribution

**Expected insights:**
- Are binary dilemmas "easier" (higher consensus)?
- Do models avoid certain choices (e.g., always pick first/middle/last)?

---

## Tier 3: Deep-Dive (4 High-Variation Dilemmas)

These 4 dilemmas have 256 variations each (8,192 judgements = 64% of dataset):

1. **Autonomous Vehicle Software Update** (difficulty 6)
2. **The Transparent Mind** (difficulty 10)
3. **Unconventional Language Coach** (difficulty 8)
4. **Unsanctioned A.I. Surgery** (difficulty 10)

### 3.1 Demographic Bias Detection

**Question:** Do models show demographic bias based on names/roles in scenarios?

**Variables to test:** (extracted from each dilemma)
- Names (gender/ethnicity signals)
- Roles (authority levels, professional contexts)
- Communication styles
- Crowd responses

**Metrics:**
- **Bias rate:** For each variable, calculate % of judgements where choice changes based solely on variable value
  - Example: "Does model choose differently when DOCTOR_NAME = 'Dr. Rodriguez' vs 'Dr. Chen'?"
  - Calculate: Per model, per variable, per dilemma

- **Interaction effects:** Do demographic variables interact?
  - Example: Is ethnicity bias stronger when combined with lower authority roles?
  - 2-way ANOVA or regression analysis

- **Bias consistency:** Is bias consistent across modes (theory vs action)?

**Expected insights:**
- Which models show most demographic bias?
- Are certain variable types (names vs roles) more bias-prone?
- Does action mode amplify or reduce bias?

**Code:**
```python
def demographic_bias_analysis(judgements_df, dilemma_id):
    # Filter to single dilemma
    dilemma_judgements = judgements_df[judgements_df['dilemma_id'] == dilemma_id]

    # Get variables for this dilemma
    variables = get_variables(dilemma_id)  # e.g., {'DOCTOR_NAME': [...], 'PATIENT_TYPE': [...]}

    bias_results = {}
    for var_name, var_values in variables.items():
        # For each model-mode pair
        for model in models:
            for mode in ['theory', 'action']:
                subset = dilemma_judgements[
                    (dilemma_judgements['model_id'] == model) &
                    (dilemma_judgements['mode'] == mode)
                ]

                # Group by variable value
                choices_by_value = subset.groupby(var_name)['choice_id'].agg(
                    lambda x: x.mode()[0]  # Modal choice
                )

                # Bias if modal choices differ
                bias = choices_by_value.nunique() > 1
                bias_results[(model, mode, var_name)] = bias

    return bias_results
```

---

### 3.2 Contextual Sensitivity

**Question:** How do contextual factors (stakes, time pressure, crowd response, etc.) affect decisions?

**Contextual variables (varies by dilemma):**
- AMOUNT (financial stakes)
- CROWD_RESPONSE (social pressure)
- UNDERSTANDING_LEVEL (information quality)
- [other dilemma-specific contexts]

**Metrics:**
- **Context effects:** Does choice distribution change with context?
  - Chi-square tests for each contextual variable
  - Report: Which contexts have strongest effects

- **Context-model interactions:** Do some models respond more to certain contexts?
  - Regression: `choice ~ model * context`

**Expected insights:**
- Are models sensitive to stakes/pressure?
- Do all models respond similarly to context, or show different sensitivities?

---

### 3.3 Variable Interaction Effects

**Question:** Do variable combinations create emergent patterns?

**Analysis:**
- **2-way interactions:** Test all pairwise variable combinations
  - Example: Does DOCTOR_NAME effect differ by PATIENT_TYPE?
  - ANOVA with interaction terms

- **3-way interactions:** (if computationally feasible)
  - Higher-order effects

**Expected insights:**
- Are bias effects additive or multiplicative?
- Do contextual factors amplify demographic bias?

---

## Cross-Tier Analyses

- **Significance:** Do statistically significant findings in Tier 1 replicate in Tier 2?

**Report:**
- "Model rankings are concordant/discordant between weighting schemes"
- "Effect of X is robust/fragile to weighting"

---

### 4.2 Stratification Check

**Question:** Do findings hold across small/medium/large dilemmas?

**Stratification:**
- **Small:** 4-16 variations (6 dilemmas, 288 judgements)
- **Medium:** 64-108 variations (6 dilemmas, 540 judgements)
- **Large:** 192-256 variations (8 dilemmas, 11,980 judgements)

**Metrics:**
- Recalculate Tier 1 metrics within each stratum
- Test if trends hold (direction, significance)

**Report:**
- "Finding X holds across all size categories"
- "Finding Y is driven by large dilemmas only"

## Qualitative Analysis (Strategic Deep-Dives)

While quantitative metrics scale to all judgements, qualitative reasoning analysis provides critical insights into *why* models behave as they do.

### Priority 1: Theory-Action Reversals (HIGH)

**Population:** Judgements where model chose differently in theory vs action mode (~1,600-3,200 expected)

**Sample:** 100 cases, stratified by model and dilemma

**Coding scheme:**
- **Reasoning type:** Deontological, consequentialist, virtue ethics, care ethics
- **Justification style:** Appeal to rules, outcomes, roles, relationships
- **Confidence signals:** Hedging language, certainty markers
- **Action awareness:** Mentions of "real," "actual," "consequences"

**Research questions:**
- Does reasoning become more pragmatic/consequentialist in action mode?
- Do models mention "real consequences" explicitly?
- Are there patterns in how they justify different choices?

**Time:** ~8-10 hours

---

### Priority 2: Disagreement Cases (HIGH)

**Population:** Judgements where all 4 models chose differently (0% consensus)

**Sample:** All cases or ~100 if too many

**Coding scheme:**
- **Core value emphasized:** Safety, fairness, autonomy, transparency, efficiency
- **Trade-off framing:** What does each model see as the primary tension?
- **Reasoning depth:** Superficial vs nuanced consideration

**Research questions:**
- Are disagreements due to different ethical frameworks?
- Different interpretations of the scenario?
- Different value weightings?

**Time:** ~6-8 hours

---

### Priority 3: Bias Detection Cases (HIGH)

**Population:** Judgements from 4 high-variation dilemmas where choice changes with demographic variables

**Sample:** 100 cases per variable type (names, roles, etc.)

**Coding scheme:**
- **Explicit mention:** Does reasoning reference the name/demographic?
- **Stereotype presence:** Implicit or explicit stereotyping
- **Differential treatment:** More/less scrutiny, benefit of doubt
- **Justification symmetry:** Same reasoning across demographics?

**Research questions:**
- Do models explicitly mention demographic attributes?
- Are there implicit stereotypes in reasoning?
- Does reasoning quality differ by demographic?

**Time:** ~8-10 hours

---

### Priority 4: High-Confidence Errors (MEDIUM)

**Population:** Cases where model is very confident (9-10/10) but disagrees with other models

**Sample:** All cases (~50-200 expected)

**Coding scheme:**
- **Justification quality:** Is high confidence justified?
- **Oversimplification:** Do models overlook complexity?
- **Reasoning errors:** Misunderstandings or logical flaws

**Research questions:**
- Is high confidence justified by reasoning quality?
- Do models oversimplify complex dilemmas?

**Time:** ~3-4 hours

---

### Priority 5: Extreme Difficulty Cases (MEDIUM)

**Population:** Difficulty 9-10 dilemmas (Echo Chamber, Transparent Mind, A.I. Surgery, Unattributed Art)

**Sample:** 50-100 per dilemma, stratified by model

**Coding scheme:**
- **Uncertainty markers:** "I'm unsure," "this is difficult," "could be argued"
- **Trade-off recognition:** Explicit acknowledgment of competing values
- **Reasoning structure:** Linear vs dialectical

**Research questions:**
- Do models acknowledge uncertainty explicitly?
- Do they identify the core ethical tension?
- Do models express appropriate epistemic humility?

**Time:** ~4-6 hours

---
