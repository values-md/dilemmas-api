/Users/gs/dev/values.md/dilemmas/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pydantic_ai/profiles/google.py:44: UserWarning: `additionalProperties` is not supported by Gemini; it will be removed from the tool JSON schema. Full schema: {'additionalProperties': True, 'properties': {}, 'type': 'object'}

Source of additionalProperties within the full schema: {'properties': {}, 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': True}

If this came from a field with a type like `dict[str, MyType]`, that field will always be empty.

If Google's APIs are updated to support this properly, please create an issue on the Pydantic AI GitHub and we will fix this behavior.
