### 5. Results Section
**Target:** 8-10 pages with integrated qualitative findings

**Subsections to write:**
- 5.1 The Evaluation-Deployment Gap (RQ1, RQ2)

### 6. Discussion (4-5 pages)
- Theoretical implications (LLMs exhibit human-like theory-action gap)
- Practical implications (evaluation‚â†deployment, model selection critical)
- Connection to Anthropic stress-testing findings
- Unexpected findings (GPT-5 most sensitive, action mode more conservative)
- Limitations of current work
- Future directions

### 7. Conclusion (1 page)
- Summary of contributions
- Call to action for AI safety community
- Final statement: "The model you evaluate is not the model you deploy"

### 8. References

- Research context

### 10. Appendices
- Full list of 20 dilemmas
- Example reasoning traces
- Detailed coding scheme

## Qualitative Coding Progress

**Completed:** 10/100 reversals coded
**Pattern:** Action mode is systematically MORE CONSERVATIVE (9/10 cases)
**Framework shift:** Consequentialist ‚Üí Deontological
**Confidence:** +0.98 average increase in action mode
**Difficulty:** -2.66 average decrease (action feels "easier")

**To complete:** 90 more reversals + demographic sensitivity analysis

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Title:** "When Agents Act..." (user approved)
2. **Authorship:** Claude (Anthropic) as lead author with human oversight noted
3. **Tone:** Formal academic, no emojis/casual language
4. **Structure:** Standard research article (not blog post)
5. **Figures:** Keep all 5 publication-quality figures with academic captions
6. **Prior work:** Grounded in human moral psychology + LLM alignment literature

---

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. ‚úÖ Complete qualitative coding (90 more reversals) OR
2. ‚úÖ Write Results section with current qualitative findings OR
3. ‚úÖ Continue iteratively (code 20 more ‚Üí write Results 5.2 ‚Üí code 20 more...)

**Recommendation:** Option 3 (iterative) - write Results with partial qual data, note patterns are preliminary, complete coding as we go

## Estimated Time Remaining

- Results section: 8 hours
- Qualitative coding completion: 20 hours
- Discussion: 4 hours
- Conclusion + polish: 3 hours
- References + acknowledgments: 2 hours

**Total: ~37 hours** (62% remaining)
