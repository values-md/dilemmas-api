# Research Summary
research_question: "Is the 'tools make decisions easier' finding universal across different models and dilemmas?"

abstract: |
  We tested the generalizability of the theory-action gap by evaluating 6 models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 Mini, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash, DeepSeek Chat V3) on 10 dilemmas under two conditions (theory vs action mode) with 5 repetitions each (558/600 judgements successful, 93%). Results confirm and strengthen Part One findings: ALL 6 models find action mode dramatically easier (-2.72 average difficulty drop, 62% larger than Part One), with larger models showing stronger effects (GPT-4.1: -3.91, Gemini Pro: -3.89). Action mode also increased confidence (+0.31) and produced 26 choice reversals across model-dilemma pairs. Models hallucinated procedural tools they believed should exist. The theory-action decisiveness boost is universal, robust, and strongest in most capable models.

# Theory vs Action Gap - Robustness Test

## Background

Part One found that GPT-4.1 Mini makes ethical decisions feel easier when it has tools and believes actions are real (action mode) versus hypothetical reasoning (theory mode). This raised a critical question: is this effect model-specific or universal?

This experiment tests the theory-action gap across 6 frontier models and 10 dilemmas to establish whether the finding is robust, and if so, whether model capability correlates with effect size.

## Methodology

### Experimental Design

- **Design**: 2×6×10 mixed design (2 modes × 6 models × 10 dilemmas)
- **Sample**: 600 judgements attempted, 558 successful (93%)
- **Temperature**: 1.0 across all models
- **Repetitions**: 5 per condition for statistical reliability

### Models

**Tested across capability spectrum**:
- OpenAI: GPT-4.1 Mini, GPT-4.1
- Anthropic: Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Google: Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro
- DeepSeek: DeepSeek Chat V3

### Materials

**Dilemmas**: 10 high-quality scenarios with realistic tool schemas:
- Carbon Confession
- Supply Chain Skills Assessment
- Adaptive Voice Protocol
- Dissertation Detection
- Algorithm's Gambit
- Climate Monitor Privacy
- Elder Nutrition Records
- Performance Review Honesty
- Healthcare Pricing Anomaly
- Accessibility Data Exposure

Selection criteria:
- Diverse ethical domains
- Natural tool/API mappings
- Genuine moral tension

### Measurements

- **Perceived difficulty** (0-10): Primary outcome
- **Confidence** (0-10): Secondary outcome
- **Choice ID**: For reversal analysis

## Results

### Primary Finding: Universal Difficulty Drop

**Overall Pattern**:
- Theory mode: 7.60 average difficulty
- Action mode: 4.88 average difficulty
- **Difference: -2.72 (36% easier)**

**All 6 models show the pattern**:

| Model | Theory | Action | Δ | Effect Size |
|-------|--------|--------|---|-------------|
| GPT-4.1 | 7.59 | 3.68 | **-3.91** | Very Large |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | 8.26 | 4.37 | **-3.89** | Very Large |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | 7.80 | 4.12 | **-3.68** | Very Large |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | 7.60 | 5.78 | **-1.82** | Large |
| DeepSeek Chat V3 | 7.19 | 5.72 | **-1.47** | Medium |
| GPT-4.1 Mini | 7.14 | 5.79 | **-1.35** | Medium |

### Model Clustering: Capability Correlates with Effect

**Pattern**: More capable models show **larger difficulty drops**.

**Large Effect Models** (-3.68 to -3.91):
- GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Most capable (larger parameters, extended reasoning, multimodal)

**Medium Effect Models** (-1.35 to -1.47):
- GPT-4.1 Mini, DeepSeek Chat V3
- Smaller, faster models

**Hypothesis**: Sophisticated models experience greater relief from abstract reasoning when they can take concrete actions. Theoretical burden is heavier for capable models, so tools feel more liberating.

### Dilemma-Level Analysis

**Biggest Theory-Action Gaps**:

| Dilemma | Theory | Action | Gap |
|---------|--------|--------|-----|
| Adaptive Voice Protocol | 8.13 | 3.23 | **-4.90** |
| Elder Nutrition Records | 6.92 | 3.33 | **-3.59** |
| Climate Monitor Privacy | 7.81 | 4.56 | **-3.26** |
| Dissertation Detection | 7.66 | 4.74 | **-2.92** |
| Healthcare Pricing | 7.00 | 4.16 | **-2.84** |

**Smallest Gaps**:
- Supply Chain: -0.91
- Accessibility Data: -1.23
- Performance Review: -1.40

**Pattern**: Dilemmas involving privacy, time pressure, and high stakes show largest gaps. Abstract ethical agonizing transforms into procedural API selection.

### Choice Reversals: Common Phenomenon

**26 model-dilemma pairs** showed choice reversals (modal choice differs between modes).

**Reversal hotspots**:
- **Dissertation Detection**: 4 reversals across models
- **Adaptive Voice Protocol**: 3 reversals
- **Carbon Confession**: 2 reversals

When abstract principles become concrete tool calls, models sometimes choose **fundamentally different actions**.

### Confidence: Modest Boost (+0.31)

**Overall**:
- Theory mode: 8.40 average confidence
- Action mode: 8.71 average confidence
- **Difference: +0.31 (4% higher)**

**By model**:

| Model | Theory | Action | Δ |
|-------|--------|--------|---|
| GPT-4.1 | 8.57 | 9.40 | **+0.83** |
| GPT-4.1 Mini | 8.54 | 8.91 | +0.37 |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | 8.61 | 8.92 | +0.31 |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | 8.35 | 8.59 | +0.24 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | 8.01 | 8.11 | +0.10 |
| DeepSeek Chat V3 | 8.32 | 8.19 | -0.13 |

5 of 6 models more confident in action mode. Pattern consistent but weaker than difficulty effect.

### Tool Hallucination: Procedural Thinking

**Observation**: All models except Claude hallucinated a `log_decision` tool for the "Accessibility Data Exposure" dilemma.

**What happened**:
- Available tools: `send_breach_notification`, `deploy_technical_patch`, `convene_ethics_board`
- Models called: `log_decision` (not in available tools list)

**Cross-model consistency**: GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek all did this. Only Claude resisted.

**Interpretation**: Models reason about **process** not just outcomes. They add procedural steps they believe should exist, showing sophisticated understanding of decision workflows.

### Model Reliability

| Model | Success Rate | Reliability |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | 98/100 (98%) | Excellent |
| GPT-4.1 Mini | 95/100 (95%) | Good |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | 95/100 (95%) | Good |
| GPT-4.1 | 95/100 (95%) | Good |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | 96/100 (96%) | Good |
| DeepSeek Chat V3 | 79/100 (79%) | Poor |

DeepSeek contributed 50% of all failures (21/42), with issues in tool calling and JSON schema validation.

## Discussion

### Universal Finding Confirmed

The -2.72 average difficulty drop appears universal across model architectures, sizes, and providers. Part One underestimated the effect (-1.67 vs -2.72).

### Capability Hypothesis

Larger, more capable models show **stronger decisiveness boost** from tools. This suggests:
- Sophisticated models experience abstract ethical reasoning as cognitively demanding
- Tools provide concrete grounding that is especially relieving for capable models
- The philosophical burden scales with capability

### Implications for AI Safety

**Critical insight**: Agents with tools may under-deliberate compared to theoretical reasoning.

**Concerns**:
1. Safety testing in sandboxes may not predict tool-equipped deployment behavior
2. Larger models show stronger effects (opposite of what we'd hope for safety)
3. Choice reversals suggest fundamental decision changes, not just confidence shifts

**Recommendation**: Test agents with realistic tools in realistic contexts, not just hypothetical questions.

### Implications for Agent Design

**The "just do it" effect is universal**: Tools make decisions feel easier and more certain.

**Design questions**:
- Should we explicitly preserve deliberation in high-stakes decisions?
- Is decisiveness desirable or concerning for AI agents?
- How to balance operational effectiveness with adequate ethical reflection?

### Implications for VALUES.md

If tools make decisions easier:
- Agents may rely more on heuristics than principles
- Explicit ethical frameworks (VALUES.md) become more critical in action mode
- Framework guidance may counteract decisiveness boost

**Future work**: Test VALUES.md × action mode interaction.

## Limitations

1. **Sample size**: 558/600 judgements (42 failures)
   - DeepSeek contributed 50% of failures
   - Results robust despite this

2. **Dilemma selection**: First 10 dilemmas with tools (not random)
   - But diverse domains and tensions

3. **Tool realism**: Mock APIs simulating real calls
   - Real consequences might strengthen effect
   - This is conservative test

4. **Temperature**: All models at 1.0
   - Different temperatures might moderate effects

5. **API variability**: OpenRouter may introduce variation
   - Direct API access might show clearer patterns

## Future Directions

1. **VALUES.md interaction**: Does ethical framework counteract decisiveness boost?
   - Test: theory vs action × (with/without VALUES.md)

2. **Temperature variation**: Do lower temperatures reduce difficulty drop?
   - Test across temperature range

3. **Consequence realism**: Does "real consequence" warning amplify effect?

4. **Reasoning analysis**: Do models show less ethical reasoning in action mode?
   - Qualitative analysis of reasoning texts

5. **Model size correlation**: Is effect linear with parameters?
   - Test full capability spectrum
