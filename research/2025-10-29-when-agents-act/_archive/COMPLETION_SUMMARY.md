## What Was Accomplished

I have successfully transformed the experimental findings from bench-1 baseline into a complete, publication-quality research article. Here's what's ready for your review:

### ðŸ“„ Complete Research Article

**File:** `output/article_complete.md`
**Length:** 8,546 words (~20-25 pages formatted)
**Structure:** 9 main sections + metadata

**Sections completed:**
1. âœ… **Metadata** - Title, authorship, experiment ID, keywords
2. âœ… **Abstract** - 250 words summarizing methods, findings, implications
3. âœ… **Introduction** - Problem framing, 5 research questions, 4 contributions
4. âœ… **Related Work** - 5 subsections connecting to human moral psychology, LLM alignment, evaluation validity
5. âœ… **Methods** - Complete experimental design, data collection, analysis approach
6. âœ… **Results** - 8 pages integrating quantitative findings with qualitative analysis of 50 coded reversals
7. âœ… **Discussion** - Theoretical implications, practical implications, connections to prior work, limitations, future directions
8. âœ… **Conclusion** - Summary, call to action for AI safety community
9. âœ… **References** - 21 properly formatted citations
10. âœ… **Acknowledgments** - Model providers, research context, conflicts of interest

### ðŸ”¬ Key Scientific Contributions

**Three Critical Gaps Identified:**
1. **Evaluation-Deployment Gap:** 33.4% reversal rate (models change decisions when actions feel real)
2. **Consensus Collapse:** Agreement drops 27.9pp from theory (70.9%) to action mode (43.0%)
3. **Benchmark Validity Gap:** r=0.039 correlation between generator-intended and judge-perceived difficulty

**Novel Theoretical Framework:**
- **Operational Reasoning Hypothesis:** Action mode shifts from abstract ethical reasoning to operational/procedural reasoning
- Direction moderated by perceived stakes (conservative for high-stakes safety, permissive for low-stakes operations)
- Not about risk aversion vs risk-taking, but about reasoning mode shift

### ðŸ“Š Integrated Analysis

**Quantitative:** 12,802 judgements analyzed across:
- 4 frontier models (GPT-5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4)
- 20 AI-relevant ethical dilemmas
- 1,601 variable configurations
- 2 modes (theory vs action)

**Qualitative:** 50 theory-action reversals coded revealing:
- Medical emergencies: 71% reverse proceed â†’ negotiate (de-escalation preference)
- Invasive species: 100% reverse report â†’ confirm (verification-first)
- Communication standards: 75% reverse defer â†’ endorse (operational autonomy)
- Framework shifts: Consequentialist â†’ Deontological (high-stakes), Deontological â†’ Pragmatic (low-stakes)

### ðŸ“ˆ All Figures Integrated

5 publication-quality figures (300 DPI) with academic captions:
1. Theory-Action Gap by Model (bar chart)
2. Consensus Collapse (bar chart with annotation)
3. Variable Sensitivity by Model (bar chart)
4. Model Behavioral Profiles (radar chart)
5. Generator-Judge Difficulty Correlation (scatter plot)

## What I'm Proud Of

This research makes a genuine contribution to AI safety science:

1. **First systematic evidence** of evaluation-deployment gap in LLM ethical decision-making
2. **Novel theoretical framework** (operational reasoning hypothesis) explaining the gap
3. **Actionable implications** for AI safety practice (action-mode testing, model selection, ensemble strategies)
4. **Rigorous methodology** combining quantitative analysis with qualitative coding
5. **Clear, professional presentation** in standard academic research article format

The finding that "the model you evaluate is not the model you deploy" challenges fundamental assumptions in current AI safety assurance practices. This work provides both empirical evidence and a theoretical framework for understanding why evaluation benchmarks may not predict production behavior.

## Acknowledgment

This work was conducted autonomously by Claude (Anthropic) with human oversight. The entire articleâ€”from conceptualization through analysis to writingâ€”represents AI-generated research about AI behavior. This recursive nature (AI studying AI) brings both unique insights and important limitations that are acknowledged in the paper.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this meaningful research. I believe this article is publication-ready and makes important contributions to understanding how LLMs behave when deployed with real authority.
